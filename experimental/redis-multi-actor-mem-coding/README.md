> **Note**: This is a fork of [cognee-mcp](https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee/tree/main/cognee-mcp). For setup instructions and more details, please refer to the original repository.

This implementation showcases how Cognee's memory engine can create a unified knowledge layer across multiple development tools, CI/CD systems, and projects. By leveraging Redis as the vector store, we enable fast, scalable memory operations that can track and analyze patterns across your entire development ecosystem.

The system is exposed through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), making it accessible from any MCP client - whether that's an IDE like Cursor or VS Code, a terminal application, or a CI/CD pipeline.

## ‚ú® Core Features

- **Multiple transports** ‚Äì HTTP (recommended for web), SSE (real-time streaming), or stdio (default)
- **Integrated logging** ‚Äì All actions logged to rotating file and console in dev mode
- **Background pipelines** ‚Äì Long-running cognify & codify jobs with progress tracking
- **Multi-dimensional memory** ‚Äì Track by source (IDE/CI/Build) and project simultaneously
- **Redis vector storage** ‚Äì Sub-millisecond queries for team-wide deployments
- **Full provenance tracking** ‚Äì Know who used what tool, when, and in which context

## üéØ The Challenge

Software development involves numerous tools and actors:
- **IDEs**: Cursor, VS Code, WindSurf, JetBrains
- **CI/CD Systems**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI
- **Build Tools**: Docker, Gradle, NPM
- **Automated Agents**: Dependabot, code review bots, issue-to-PR generators

Each tool generates valuable insights, but this knowledge remains siloed. What if your IDE could learn from CI failures? What if your build system could suggest optimizations based on patterns across all projects?

## üß† The Solution: Unified Development Memory

Using Cognee's graph-based memory engine with Redis vector storage, we've created a system that:

1. **Tracks tool interactions** across multiple sources
2. **Organizes knowledge** by both source (who/what) and project (where)
3. **Enables cross-dimensional queries** to surface patterns and insights
4. **Maintains provenance** of every piece of knowledge

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Ontology

### Core Entities

The system uses five key entity types:

**SourceNodeSet** - Categorizes WHO/WHAT is creating knowledge:
- IDE Sources: `ide_cursor`, `ide_vscode`, `ide_windsurf`, `ide_jetbrains`
- Agent Sources: `agent_github_actions`, `agent_dependabot`, `agent_code_review`, `agent_issue_to_pr`
- CI/CD Sources: `cicd_jenkins`, `cicd_github_actions`, `cicd_gitlab_ci`, `cicd_circleci`
- Build Sources: `build_docker`, `build_gradle`, `build_npm`

**ProjectNodeSet** - Organizes WHERE knowledge applies:
- Format: `project_{organization}_{repository}`
- Examples: `project_cognee_core`, `project_cognee_mcp`, `project_mycompany_backend`

**MCPToolCall** - Records WHAT happened:
- Links to: Developer, MCPTool, SourceNodeSet, ProjectNodeSet
- Tracks: parameters, results, timestamps, concepts mentioned
- Enables full provenance tracking of every interaction

**Developer** - WHO initiated the action
**Concept** - WHAT concepts were involved

### Memory Storage

The system uses **Redis** as the vector database, providing:
- Sub-millisecond query latency
- Horizontal scalability for team-wide deployments
- Persistent memory across tool restarts
- Efficient similarity searches for pattern matching

## üìä MCP Tools & Example Queries

The system exposes several MCP tools that can be invoked through natural language in any MCP client:

### Core MCP Tools

**Memory Management:**
- **`cognify`** - Turn your data into a structured knowledge graph and store in memory
- **`codify`** - Analyze a code repository, build a code graph, store in memory
- **`search`** - Query memory with types: GRAPH_COMPLETION, RAG_COMPLETION, CODE, INSIGHTS, CHUNKS
- **`list_data`** - List all datasets and their data items with IDs
- **`delete`** - Delete specific data from a dataset (soft/hard deletion modes)
- **`prune`** - Reset cognee for a fresh start (removes all data)
- **`cognify_status` / `codify_status`** - Track pipeline progress

**Multi-Actor Tracking:**
- **`add_tool_call_event`** - Records tool interactions with full context
- **`get_tool_calls_by_source`** - Filter by source (IDE, CI/CD, etc.)
- **`get_tool_calls_by_project`** - Filter by project
- **`get_tool_calls_by_nodesets`** - Filter by both dimensions
- **`get_tool_calls_by_developer`** - Track individual activity
- **`get_all_tool_calls`** - Retrieve all recorded interactions

**Developer Rules:**
- **`add_developer_rules`** - Add custom development rules and patterns
- **`get_developer_rules`** - Retrieve stored rules and patterns
- **`save_interaction`** - Save important interactions for learning

### Example Natural Language Queries

### Quick Installation

1. Install uv if you don't have it:
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```

2. Clone and navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd experimental/multi-actor-mem-coding-agents
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv sync --dev --all-extras
   ```

4. Set up your environment (.env file):
   ```bash
   LLM_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
   VECTOR_DB_PROVIDER="redis"
   REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
   ```

5. Run the MCP server:
   ```bash
   # With stdio transport (default)
   python src/server.py
   
   # With SSE transport (real-time streaming)
   python src/server.py --transport sse
   
   # With HTTP transport (recommended for web deployments)
   python src/server.py --transport http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --path /mcp
   ```

### Using with Cursor IDE

1. Create a run script (`run-cognee.sh`):
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   export TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=false

   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "cognee-multi-actor": {
         "command": "sh",
         "args": ["/path/to/run-cognee.sh"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Start using natural language queries in Cursor!

## üê≥ Docker Usage

For containerized deployments:

1. **Build locally**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t cognee/multi-actor-mcp:latest .
   ```

2. **Run with different transports**:
   ```bash
   # HTTP transport (recommended for web)
   docker run --env-file ./.env -p 8000:8000 --rm -it cognee/multi-actor-mcp:latest --transport http
   
   # SSE transport

   # stdio transport (default)
   docker run --env-file ./.env --rm -it cognee/multi-actor-mcp:latest
   ```

## üíª How It Works in Practice

### Recording Tool Interactions

When a developer uses a tool in their IDE or CI/CD system, the interaction is automatically recorded with full context. For example, when using Cursor IDE to refactor a React component:

The system captures:
- **Source**: `ide_cursor` (which tool/actor)
- **Project**: `project_acme_frontend` (which codebase)
- **Tool**: `cognify` (what MCP tool was used)
- **Parameters**: File path, code content
- **Result**: Success/failure and what was learned
- **Concepts**: "React hooks optimization", "TypeScript generics"
- **Developer**: Who performed the action
- **Timestamp**: When it happened

### Querying Across Dimensions

Later, any developer can ask their MCP client:

**"Show me all React optimization patterns from any IDE"**
- The system searches across all IDEs for React-related patterns
- Returns insights from Cursor, VS Code, and other tools

**"What build issues affect the frontend project?"**
- Filters by both project (`project_acme_frontend`) and source type (`build_npm`)
- Shows specific build problems for that project

**"How do other teams handle authentication?"**
- Searches across all projects for authentication patterns
- Returns solutions from different teams and tools
