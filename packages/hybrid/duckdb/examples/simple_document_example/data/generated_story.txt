The Citadel of Vorrxundra

In the twilight marshes of Zyrrhalin, the air shimmered with violet mists. A solitary traveler, Khaélith Orun, adjusted the crystal plates woven into his cloak. Each plate whispered faint echoes of the past, like memories trapped in glass.

He was searching for the lost citadel of Vorrxundra, said to be guarded by the twin beings Thirvalque and Ossaryn, whose eyes were polished obsidian orbs that saw not light, but intent.

Along the way, Khaélith encountered a creature called a Fyrneloch, its body a lattice of molten threads, its voice like bells ringing underwater. It spoke:

“The path bends where silence gathers. Seek the Mirror-River, for there the citadel’s shadow is more real than its walls.”

Khaélith pressed on, guided by this riddle, until the Mirror-River appeared—its waters rippling not with current, but with the movements of forgotten futures. There, he saw his reflection splinter into countless selves: one triumphant, one broken, one simply lost.

At the river’s edge stood Vorrxundra itself, impossibly vast yet half-vanished, a city that seemed to exist only when one dared to believe it was there.

As Khaélith stepped forward, the obsidian gaze of Thirvalque and Ossaryn locked onto him. Whether they would let him pass—or consume him whole—was known only to the shadows that listened.
